        Have you ever wanted to encode personal or sensitive information into a
        barcode but do not want it readable by the entire world? Using Code's
        proprietary GoCode technology and CortexDecoder WebSDK you're about to
        experience this capability all within your web browser. In this demo
        you'll experience a simulated medication prescription to fulfill at a
        pharmacy.
